Welcome to Resistics
====================

Resistics is a native python3 package for the processing of magnetotelluric (MT) data. It incorporates standard robust processing methods and adopts a modular approach to processing which allows for customisation and future improvements to be quickly adopted.

Resistics installation instructions are provided :doc:`here <installation>`.

Find out about the useful features of Resistics in the :doc:`features <features>` section. 

Resistics uses a number of conventions which are described :doc:`here <conventions>`.

The :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>` section covers the Resistics project environment and basic processing of magnetotelluric data.

More advanced processing, including pre-processing of time series data, remote reference processing and remote reference statistics are detailed in the :doc:`advanced <advanced>` section.

A roadmap for future development can be accessed :doc:`here <roadmap>`. For those interested in contributing to the project, information can be found in this section.
